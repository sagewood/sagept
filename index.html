            <p>Physical Therapy (PT) is an effective treatment method addressing the treatment, healing and prevention of injuries and disabilities. Jennifer focuses on pain relief, healing, and restoring function and movement associated with injury. Other areas within physical therapy are ergonomic (body mechanic) training, fitness/ wellness, and especially education and prevention.</p>

            <p>Many people think they can manage their pain and rehabilitate themselves. They might have done this in the past only to find the old injury resurfaces because it wasn't adequately addressed the first time.</p>

            <p>Jennifer Anderson is trained to recognize the complicated interactions between different parts of the body, how the subtle changes brought on by injury affect the rest of the body. She's trained to recognize the difference between one dysfunction/injury from another and work with your physician to develop a rehabilitation program personalized just for you. Everyone has different types of habits, movements and even seasonal patterns. Jennifer recognizes what those are and how to rehabilitate them as needed.</p>

        <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Because of healthcare and insurance restrictions, your physician may not have the time to explain exactly what your injury/dysfunction/disability is and why/how it occurred. Sagewood Physical Therapy can educate you about the specifics of your problem and what the course of action will be to correct it and hopefully prevent it from reoccurring. Physical Therapy focuses on education, correction and prevention.</p>

            <p>Although rehab takes time, it also took time for the injury to progress to the point of causing pain or contributing to injury. Because each person is different, rates of healing are different. We can usually get an idea of your progress within 2 weeks. Even though you have other things to do, rehab is important; there is no such thing as a rushed rehabilitation.</p>

            <p>The major contributing factor in your rehabilitation is the program Jennifer gives you to do at home.</p>

            <p>Physical therapists want their patients to understand that although we are here to teach and rehabilitate them, their Home Program it is their responsibility. The Home Program is a major contributing factor to how quickly the patient recovers.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Jennifer is always observing others. She rarely sees people and athletes with perfect body mechanics, training techniques or movement patterns. This is where wellness comes into play. Typically, the most appropriate patients are those who have been in accidents (work, auto, or falls), athletes with overstress injuries, patients with arthritis, pre- and post-operative patients, and people with general deconditioning or strains.</p>

        <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Physical Therapy encompasses pain relief, strength and flexibility training, proper postural alignment, regaining movement or range of motion, improving and correcting posture, endurance training, relaxation and stress relieving techniques, balance and coordination training, proper walking, education, safety awareness and development/implementation of a home exercise program.</p>

            <p>Because each person is different, each physical therapy experience and program is different. Be patient with yourself, your physician and your physical therapist. Healing takes time, diligence and compliance. If you think you may be a candidate for physical therapy, speak to your physician or to a therapist.</p>

            <p>Massage can provide temporary relief whereas PT provides relief, restoration and healing.</p>

            <p>A skilled physical therapist creates a program that increases and maintains muscle strength and endurance, restores and increases joint range of motion, increases coordination, decreases pain, decreases muscle spasm and plasticity, decreases swelling and inflammation of joints, promotes healing of soft tissue lesions, prevents contracture and deformity of limbs, alleviates walking problems, educates patients and family, decrease stress and a whole lot more too numerous to mention. These are but a few of the benefits of physical therapy.</p>

            <p>Massages from untrained individuals may be beneficial but physical therapy provides you with a greater range of objectives for long-term healing.</p>

            <p>Some objectives are joint mobilization, soft tissue release, trigger point release, manual therapy, myofascial stretching, muscle re-education, modalities, therapeutic exercise, re-conditioning program, specific strengthening of weak muscles, and a home exercise program to name a few. These methods are not only far superior to indiscriminate kneading and pounding, but proof of the scientific nature of physical therapy.</p>

            <p>The benefits of physical therapy are not only for instant gratification in terms of comfort, but the benefits are a long term solution for afflictions, a lasting cure for those who need it.</p>

					<h2>About</h2>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
						<p class="lead">Established in 2003, Sagewood Physical Therapy North is a therapist owned private clinic located in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Jennifer has worked in both hospitals and private clinics in three states (Colorado, Kentucky, and North Carolina) as well as in a hospital in South Africa. She regularly participates in courses to provide her clients a more comprehensive approach and broader base of treatment techniques.</p>

						<h2>Jennifer Anderson</h2>

						<h3>MS Physical Therapy<br />
						Duke University</h3>

						<p>Jennifer Anderson's educational background includes a BS degree in Exercise Science from the University of Colorado Boulder and a MS degree in Physical Therapy from Duke University. Her broad range of work experience includes but is not limited to musculoskeletal, thoracic outlet, cardiopulmonary, rheumatic disorders, geriatrics, and sport injuries. She also gained experience treating traumatic hand-injury, burn and pediatric patients while in South Africa for two years.</p>

						<p>Jennifer is always seeking to further her knowledge and hone her skills through classes and training in order to provide a more comprehensive approach and broader base of treatment techniques to better serve her clients. During the twenty-three years she's spent in the field of PT, she's learned to tailor the needs of each client on a patient to patient basis. No two patients are alike and knowing that you will have the same therapist each visit, makes communication and understanding an important asset to your ultimate recovery.</p>

						<h3>Customer Testimonials</h3>
						<blockquote>
						<p>“Jennifer was very thorough as she assessed my injuries sustained from a serious car accident. She communicated her findings on a level that I could understand. She has great hands-on skills yet she made it clear that I would have to take an active role in my recovery and prevention of re-injury. She listened to my concerns and together we developed a plan with realistic goals to bring about my optimal recovery.” ~ Dawn U.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
						<p>“I finally found a therapist who would not only focus on momentary relief but who could help me prevent muscle tension that occurred as a result of work site and work load stress. Jennifer gave me ergonomic tips to improve my work site and ideas to prevent stress from becoming muscle spasms.” ~ Tristan T.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
						<p>"When I came to see Jennifer I had been suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome for several years. I had pain and tremors in my right hand. As a professional musician, it was intrinsic that I recover from these issues.</p>

						<p>Through several sessions, and a comprehensive evaluation of my technique, as well as the ergonomics of my instrument, I've since made a full recovery. I heartily recommend Jennifer to anyone with similar issues." ~ Kyle J.</p>
